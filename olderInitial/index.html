      <h2 class="intro-heading">
        I'm a currently a computing science student.

        I have the following <a href="skills.html">Skills</a>

        I consider learning to be the most important aspect of life. This
        summer, my plan is to pursue Meta front-end and back-end certifications
        to enhance my skills and prepare for next year's internships. After
        realizing that problem-solving and algorithmic techniques naturally
        improve with time, I made the decision to pursue a computer science
        degree. I believe that this degree will provide me with a strong
        foundation essential for a successful career as a software developer.
